## üè† Housing Price: Pipelines with Custom Transformer
### Summary
The purpose of this project is to predict the Sale Price. Firstly, I perform exploratory data analysis which indicate me how to prepare the data. To have more automation, I decided to make pipelines with custom transformers. After bundled all the pipelines, I use hyperparameter tuning and finally compute the score.

## Get Data
Dataset is from Kaggle competition about housing prices in Ames.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I looked at the data by dividing them into univariate and bivariate analysis.

#### Univariate Analysis - Skew

High skewness of variables will be normalized in feature engineering.

#### Bivariate Analysis - Outliers and Multicollinearity

A few outliers need to be removed.

Highly correlated variables will be dropped in feature engineering to avoid multicollinearity.

## Missing Data

Columns 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature' and 'Alley' has too many missing values. They will be dropped in feature engineering.

## Prepare the Data

In this section, I remove outliers and columns which have too many missing values and can lead to multicollinearity.

## Feature Engineering
 
I divided this section by numerical columns and categorical columns.
All functions I created can be input in steps of pipeline.
#### Numerical Columns
* CustomImputer
* AddAttributes
* DropCorrFeatures
* SkewedFeatures

#### Categorical Columns
* CustomImputer
* OrdinalEncoder

## Pipelines
The most important and satisfying section. Pipelines with which we can combine all data preprocessing!

## Modeling
I use XGBRegressor and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate score.

MAE: 14522.152
